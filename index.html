                <h2>Sreemangal Upazila</h2>
                <p>Sreemangal (Bengali: শ্রীমঙ্গল, romanized: Srimongol) is an upazila of Moulvibazar District in Sylhet Division, Bangladesh. It is located at the southwest of the district, and borders the Habiganj District to the west and the Indian state of Tripura to the south. Sreemangal is often referred to as the 'tea capital' of Bangladesh, and is most famous for its tea fields. Other than tea, the rubber, pineapple, wood, betel, and lemon industries also exist in the upazila.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>It is believed that the upazila was named after Sri Das and Mangal Das; two brothers who settled on the banks of the Hail Haor. A copper plate of Raja Marundanath from the 11th century was found in Kalapur. During an excavation at Lamua, an ancient statue of Ananta Narayan was dug out. In 1454, the Nirmai Shiva Bari was built and still stands today. Sreemangal thana was established in 1912. The central town later became a pourashava in 1935. In 1963, two peasants were killed by police officers which kicked off the Balishira peasant riots. During the Bangladesh War of Independence of 1971, the Pakistan Army reached Sreemangal on 30 April setting houses on fire and rapes were committed on women. The nearby East Pakistan Rifles camp and local Wapda office premises were among the two mass killing sites. Two mass graves remain in Bharaura with a memorial in North Bharaura.</p>
